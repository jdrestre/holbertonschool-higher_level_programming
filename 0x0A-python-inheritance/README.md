## Description
Repository to study the following Python topics: Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, lets pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions

Same class or inherit from|Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False.

Only sub class of|Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False.

[7-base_geometry.py](https://github.com/jdrestre/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-python-inheritance/7-base_geometry.py), [7-base_geometry.txt](https://github.com/jdrestre/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-python-inheritance/tests/7-base_geometry.txt)|7. Integer validator|Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).Public instance method: def integer_validator(self, name, value): that validates value:
[8-rectangle.py](https://github.com/jdrestre/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x0A-python-inheritance/8-rectangle.py)|8. Rectangle|Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).Instantiation with width and height: def __init__(self, width, height):
