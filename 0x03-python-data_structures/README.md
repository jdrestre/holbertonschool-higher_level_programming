# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description
- Repository to study the following Python topics: Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
---
At the end of this project I could explain to anyone:
- What are lists and how to use them
- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the del statement and how to use it
