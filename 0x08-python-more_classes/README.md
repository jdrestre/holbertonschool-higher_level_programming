0-rectangle.py|0. Simple rectangle|Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle:
1-rectangle.py|1. Real definition of a rectangle|Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py) Private instance attribute, property, property setter,Raise TypeError and Raise ValueError
2-rectangle.py|2. Area and Perimeter|Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 1-rectangle.py) Public instance method
3-rectangle.py|3. String representation|Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 2-rectangle.py) Print rectangle with character '#'
4-rectangle.py|4. Eval is magic|Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 3-rectangle.py) using repr() should return a string to be able to recreate a new instance by using eval()
