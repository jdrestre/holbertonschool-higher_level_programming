## Description
Repository to study the following Python topics: Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, lets pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions
