# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Description
- Repository to study the following Python topics: Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
---
At the end of this project I could explain to anyone:
- What are set and how to use them
- What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
- When to use sets versus lists
- How to iterate into a set
- What are dictionary and how to use them
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
- What is a key in a dictionary
- How to iterate into a dictionary
- What is a lambda function
- What is map, reduce and map functions
